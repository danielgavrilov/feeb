    "## 3. Ingredient Duplication Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current Behavior: NO Deduplication\n",
    "\n",
    "**When a recipe is analyzed by the LLM:**\n",
    "1. The LLM identifies ingredients (e.g., \"soy sauce\", \"wheat flour\")\n",
    "2. For EACH ingredient, a **NEW** `Ingredient` record is created with:\n",
    "   - `code = 'llm:<random_uuid>'` (e.g., `'llm:a1b2c3d4...'`)\n",
    "   - `name = <ingredient_name>` (e.g., `'soy sauce'`)\n",
    "   - `source = 'llm'`\n",
    "3. This new ingredient is linked to the recipe via `RecipeIngredient`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** If 100 recipes all contain \"soy sauce\", there will be **100 separate ingredient records** for soy sauce in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Happens\n",
    "See `apps/api/app/services/menu_upload.py`, line 406:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ingredient_code = f\"llm:{uuid4().hex}\"  # Always generates unique code\n",
    "ingredient_id = await dal.insert_ingredient(\n",
    "    session,\n",
    "    code=ingredient_code,  # Unique every time\n",
    "    name=name,\n",
    "    source=\"llm\",\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### OFF Ingredients: Are They Used?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Implementation:** OFF ingredients are **NOT** used to match LLM-detected ingredients.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is NO code that:\n",
    "- Looks up existing OFF ingredients by name\n",
    "- Matches LLM ingredient names to OFF canonical names\n",
    "- Reuses OFF ingredient IDs for recipes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential Use Case:** You could modify the code to:\n",
    "1. When LLM identifies an ingredient, search the `ingredient` table for `source='off'` with similar name\n",
    "2. If found, reuse that `ingredient_id` instead of creating a new one\n",
    "3. This would provide canonical ingredient names and reduce duplication\n",

    "\n",
    "### Current State Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "\u2705 **What IS being used:**\n",
    "- LLM-generated ingredients (`source='llm'`)\n",
    "- Recipe-ingredient links\n",
    "- Allergen canonical list (shared by both OFF and LLM)\n",
    "- Menu upload pipeline with Gemini\n",
    "\n",
    "\u274c **What is NOT being used:**\n",
    "- Product table (3.5M rows, **never queried in production**)\n",
    "- Product-ingredient links (millions of rows, **never queried**)\n",
    "- Product-allergen links (never queried)\n",
    "- OFF ingredients (canonical taxonomy exists but **not matched to recipes**)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issues Identified\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ingredient Duplication:**\n",
    "   - Every recipe creates its own ingredient instances\n",
    "   - \"Soy sauce\" in 50 recipes \u2192 50 duplicate ingredient rows\n",
    "   - No canonical matching or deduplication\n",
    "   - Code location: `apps/api/app/services/menu_upload.py`, line 406\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Large Unused Dataset:**\n",
    "   - Product table is ~10GB+ after full import (3.5M products)\n",
    "   - Product-ingredient links are even larger (millions of relationships)\n",
    "   - This data is downloaded, processed, stored, but **never accessed**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **OFF Ingredients Unused:**\n",
    "   - OFF ingredient taxonomy could provide canonical names\n",
    "   - OFF allergen mappings could improve accuracy\n",
    "   - But there's **no code** to match LLM ingredients to OFF ingredients\n",
    "   - Recipes never reference OFF ingredients (confirmed by query above)\n",

    "### Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Option 1: Remove OFF Product Data (Keep Ingredients) \u2b50 RECOMMENDED**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to remove:**\n",

    "- Massive storage savings (~90% reduction)\n",
    "- Faster database dumps/restores\n",
    "- Lower hosting costs\n",
    "- Faster deploys\n",
    "- No impact on current functionality\n",

    "1. **Quick Win:** Remove product tables \u2192 immediate 90%+ storage reduction\n",
    "2. **No Risk:** Doesn't affect current functionality at all\n",

    "4. **Reversible:** Easy to re-import if needed (though unlikely)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next steps after Option 1:**\n",
    "- Monitor storage and performance\n",
    "- Optionally implement ingredient matching (use OFF taxonomy)\n",
    "- Consider deduplication for LLM ingredients\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation priority:**\n",
    "1. Backup database\n",
    "2. Drop product tables (SQL above)\n",
    "3. Modify import script to skip Step 4\n",
    "4. Update documentation\n",
